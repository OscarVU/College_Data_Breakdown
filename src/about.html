    <p>Design Critique:</p>
    <p>In terms of understandability, the graph I drew isn't that understandable
      without additional information written, as I fail to communicate the details of each axis
    and explain what I'm measuring. In terms of signifiers, ideally I'd make each dot clickable
    and link directly to the micro page, but I don't signify that. In terms of comfort, the space of the
    page is compact and provides a comfortable environment for the user. In terms of privacy, we do a pretty
    good job keeping the information private, as no institutional names are disclosed.</p>

    <p>Design Critique:</p>
    <p>In terms of understandability, I'd say that my sketch is clear in
      communicating its percentages through the geometric/proportional
      representations on the graph. In terms of signifiers, ideally I'd make each
      individual piece display more data when the user hovers
      over it, but I don't signify that. In terms of comfort, the space of the
      page is compact and provides a comfortable environment for the user. In terms of privacy, we do a pretty
      good job keeping the information private, as we keep the name of the university anonymous.</p>
